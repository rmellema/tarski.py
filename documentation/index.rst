Welcome to tarski.py's documentation!
=====================================
This is the documentation for `tarski.py`, a small utility for transforming a
`Tarski's World`_ `.wld` file into the corresponding first-order structure under
the empty variable assignment. Here you will be able to find all the information
about running the program, as well as its API for manipulating a blocks world
and reading in Tarski's World files.
